# Project : Cardiac Risk Prediction using Machine Learning
# Description :
We have used Machine learning which is applied to medical records can be useful to predict the survival of a patient, highlighting patterns and even ranking the features to understand which are risk factors, possibly undetectable by doctors.
In this notebook the analisys will be done starting from an EDA to understand the dataset and applying some preprocessing to be able to learn properly from it.
Then will follow a number of machine learning models trained on the preprocessed dataset, aiming to predict the survival of patients that suffered HF.
