# Cardiac Risk Prediction using Machine Learning
## Overview :
This project focuses on predicting cardiac risks using Machine Learning techniques applied to medical records. By analyzing patient data, the project aims to highlight patterns, rank risk factors, and predict survival rates for individuals who have experienced heart failure. The insights generated can assist doctors in identifying key risk factors that may not be immediately apparent through traditional analysis.

# Features :
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Initial analysis to understand the dataset, highlight trends, and identify correlations.
- Data Preprocessing:
Techniques like handling missing values, scaling, and feature selection to prepare the dataset for effective learning.
- Machine Learning Models:
Various algorithms trained on preprocessed data to predict survival outcomes.
- Insights Generation:
Identification of significant risk factors affecting cardiac health and patient survival.
