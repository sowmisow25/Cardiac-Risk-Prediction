# Cardiac Risk Prediction using Machine Learning 

</div>

## Overview :
This project focuses on predicting cardiac risks using Machine Learning techniques applied to medical records. By analyzing patient data, the project aims to highlight patterns, rank risk factors, and predict survival rates for individuals who have experienced heart failure. The insights generated can assist doctors in identifying key risk factors that may not be immediately apparent through traditional analysis.

## Features :
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Initial analysis to understand the dataset, highlight trends, and identify correlations.

### 2. Data Preprocessing:
- Techniques like handling missing values, scaling, and feature selection to prepare the dataset for effective learning.

### 3. Machine Learning Models:
- Various algorithms trained on preprocessed data to predict survival outcomes.

### 4. Insights Generation:
- Identification of significant risk factors affecting cardiac health and patient survival.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information on patients who experienced heart failure, capturing details such as:
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Health conditions** (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure)
- **Blood test results**

## Tech Stack

### Languages and Libraries
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn

### Tools
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading:**
   - Load and inspect the dataset.

2. **EDA:**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends and relationships.

3. **Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing data, scale features, and prepare the dataset for model training.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Train multiple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

6. **Insights:**
   - Analyze feature importance and identify key cardiac risk factors.

## Results

### Best Model Performance:
- Achieved an accuracy of **89%** using a combination of optimized hyperparameters and preprocessing techniques.

### Key Insights:
- **Age** and **blood pressure** are critical predictors of cardiac risk.
- Certain comorbidities like **diabetes** and **chronic kidney disease** significantly influence survival rates.
